    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="bruh">Mix in the yeast and lukewarm water and let sit for about 8 minutes</li>
      <li class="bruh">In a seperate bowl add bread flour,granulated sugar, and fine sea salt and mix.</li>
      <li class="bruh">Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, add in half of the mixture of bread flour, granulated sugar, and fine sea salt with the yeast and lukewarm water mixture, and then add 3 tablespoons good extra virgin olive oil. Mix until thourgly combined </li>
      <li class="bruh">Switch to a dough hook attachment and add the other half of the flour, sugar, and salt mixture. Mix together until smooth and elastic (about 2 to 3 minutes)</li>
      <li class="bruh">Shape your dough into a ball and lightly grease a medium sized bowl with olive oil, stick the ball of dough in there and wrap it up with  lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel. </li>
      <li class="bruh">Let it rise for about an hour or until its doubled in size</li>

      <li class="bruh">Lightly flour a work surface, dump your dough on it and cut the dough into 12 even pieces (55-60g). Let the pieces sit for 12 minutes under a damp tower  or plastic wrap</li>
      <li class="bruh"> Shape your dough and let sit under a damp towel or plastic wrap for 45 more minutes</li>
      <li class="bruh">Once they are done proofing place them in an oven set to 425'F for 13 minutes or until golden brown </li>
      <li class="bruh">While the breadsticks are baking in a sauce pan heat 1/4 (56g) of butter, take off the heat and grate 2-3 cloves of garlic(you dont want to cook the garlic your just giving the butter a garlicy taste). Let that sit for about 30 seconds then strain the garlic out of the butter(obviously by putting it in another container)</li>
      <li class="bruh">Remove the breadsticks after the timer is done and then immediately soak the breadsticks with the butter "sauce" and then finally add salt ontop.</li>
